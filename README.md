# Rewriting the Photoelectric Effect Using Recursive Radiation Transfer Instead of Particle-Wave Duality

The Photoelectric Effect is historically considered "proof" of photons, since light appears to eject electrons only at certain frequencies, seemingly behaving like discrete particles rather than continuous waves.

However, the Photon Model is a flawed interpretation because it assumes energy transfer is a particle-based event rather than a recursive Radiation interaction.

We replace it with the Recursive Radiation Transfer Model (RRTM), which shows that:
* Electrons do not absorb "photons."
* Energy absorption is a function of recursive Surface Interactions.
* The "threshold frequency" is a resonance condition, not proof of quantized photons.

"Definition 9   A Surface Interaction describes the remainder of the process of the storage or extraction of Energy.

The most simple Surface Interaction might be the absorption of Radiation into a Mass Structure that looses a single Electron, which rejoins another similar Atom in the surface of the Mass Structure that has a valence one Electron short."
